## 🚀 About Me
I am a Junior Frontend Developer with a technical background and strong motivation to grow in the IT industry. On a daily basis, I work with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript, building modern, responsive, and functional user interfaces.

For me, frontend development is not only about writing code, but also about design, usability, performance, and accessibility. I focus on writing clean, readable, and well-structured code, following best practices and a component-based approach.
